Field of Study: Software Engineering and Information Technologies
Project: Multi-Agent Pac-Man
Student: Marko Suhanov

Description:

The task required the implementation of the following agents and functionalities:

Reflex Agent:

Developed a reflex agent that evaluates possible moves based on food and ghost locations using a custom evaluation function.
Minimax Agent:

Implemented the Minimax algorithm for adversarial search. The agent considers multiple ghost responses to determine the optimal move for Pac-Man.
AlphaBeta Agent:

Enhanced the Minimax agent with Alpha-Beta pruning. This optimization reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree, allowing for deeper searches and more efficient decision-making.
Expectimax Agent:

Created an Expectimax agent to account for the probabilistic behavior of ghosts. This algorithm models ghost movements as random events and adjusts Pac-Man's strategy accordingly.
Evaluation Function:

Designed an advanced evaluation function to optimize Pac-Man's performance. The function considers factors such as distances to food and ghosts, and remaining food pellets, to calculate the best possible moves.
Algorithms Used
Reflex Agent: Simple heuristic-based evaluation function.
Minimax Algorithm: A decision-making algorithm used for adversarial search.
Alpha-Beta Pruning: An optimization technique for the Minimax algorithm to reduce the number of nodes evaluated.
Expectimax Algorithm: A variant of the Minimax algorithm that handles probabilistic outcomes, useful for modeling the random behavior of ghosts.
